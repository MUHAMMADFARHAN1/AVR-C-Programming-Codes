# AVR-C-Programming-Codes
This Repository contains basic concepts of AVR microcontroller programming including:

1, IO Access, Pin access including setting, resetting and scanning
2, The concept of Timers in AVR for timed events
3, The concept of UART and using UART in code
4, ADC access and reading
5, The concept of interrupts and interrupt programming
6, LCD interfacing with an AVR board

The broadly is similar to the basic course on AVR that I attended during a short training.
